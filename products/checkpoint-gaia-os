# Template to be used to generate a link for the releases (optional).
# Available variables inside the template are:
# - __RELEASE_CYCLE__: will be replaced by the value of `releaseCycle`,
# - __LATEST__: will be replaced by the value of `latest`,
# - __CODENAME__: will be replaced by the optional `codename`.
# You can even use Liquid Templating inside the template, such as:
#   https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-__LATEST__
# Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible.
#changelogTemplate: "https://link/of/the/__RELEASE_CYCLE__/and/__LATEST__/version"
changelogTemplate: "https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/__RELEASE_CYCLE__/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP___RELEASE_CYCLE___RN/Content/Topics-RN/Whats-New.htm"
  

# Template that generates names for every release (optional, default = "__RELEASE_CYCLE__").
# It supports the same variables as changelogTemplate.
#releaseLabel: "MoM Timeturner __RELEASE_CYCLE__ (__CODENAME__)"

eolColumn: End of Support
releaseColumn: Latest
releaseDateColumn: true


# Custom columns configuration (optional).
# Custom columns are columns that will be added to the releases table and populated based on a
# custom release cycle property.
# They can be used for documenting things such as related runtime versions, custom dates that
# cannot be expressed using the default columns, etc.
# Note that the use of a table include (see https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/blob/master/products/ansible.md)
# is usually preferred when there is more than two or three custom columns.
customColumns:

  # Name of the custom property in release cycles (mandatory).
  # If the release cycle does not declare this property, the label 'N/A' will be displayed instead.
  # Custom properties follows the camel-case syntax for naming.
  - property: supportedIosVersions

    # Position of the custom column in the table (mandatory).
    # Allowed values are:
    # - after-release-column: this is typically used for documenting related runtime versions
    #   (such as the supported iOS version range for iphone models),
    # - before-latest-column: this is typically used for documenting additional dates
    #   (such as an obsolescence date for an iphone model - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624),
    # - after-latest-column: this is typically used for documenting a corresponding latest version
    #   number (such as the OpenJDK version for https://endoflife.date/azul-zulu).
    # If multiple columns have the same position, the order of the column in the customColumns list
    # will be respected.
    position: after-release-column

    # Label of the custom column (mandatory).
    # It will be displayed in the table header.
    label: iOS

    # A description of what contains the custom column (optional).
    # It will be displayed as a tooltip of the column table header cell.
    description: Supported iOS versions

    # A link that gives more information about what contains the custom column (optional).
    # It will be used to transform the table label to a link.

# Auto-update release configuration (optional).
# This is used for automatically updating `releaseDate`, `latest`, and `latestReleaseDate` for every release.
# Multiple configurations are allowed.
# Please visit https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Automation for more details.
# The presence of such configuration modifies the product page so that users are informed that existing
# releases are automatically updated with latest versions.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
auto:
  # Mark auto-update as being cumulative (optional, default = false).
  # This means that the data won't be deleted before fetching new data.
  # Activating cumulative updates is not recommended for most products, but could be useful for products that:
  # - have a long history of releases that is long to fetch,
  # - have a history of releases that is not available anymore.
  cumulative: true
  methods:
    # Configuration for auto-update based on a custom script in the release-data repository.
    # The value must be the script name in the release-data repository, without it's '.py' extension.
    - custom: script-name

# A list of identifiers that can be used to detect this product as being used,
# especially by SBOM tooling
# Please see https://endoflife.date/help/identifiers-needed/ for more information
identifiers:
  # Each identifier is a way of linking this product to various methods of installing it

  # This is a shorthand to use repology as the source data
  # https://repology.org/project/:package-name-/versions
  # should return a valid list of packages linked to this product.
  - repology: package-name

  # See the PURL spec https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec
  # for details, and avoid packages that are already mentioned on
  # the repology page
  # Common examples would be to use
  # - pkg:os to document operating systems (https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/161)
  # - pkg:github to link to GitHub pages
  # - pkg:golang/pypi/gem/maven/npm etc for common package managers
  # - pkg:docker for linking to docker images on Docker Hub
  - purl: pkg:package-manager/package-name

# A list of releases, supported or not (mandatory).
# Releases must be sorted from the newest (on top of the list) to the lowest.
# Do not add releases that are not considered "stable" (such as RC/Alpha/Beta/Nightly).
releases:

    # Release range (mandatory, always put in quotes).
    # This is usually major.minor. Do not prefix with "v" or suffix with ".x".
    # This becomes part of our API URL, so try to avoid spaces and use lowercase for words.
-   releaseCycle: "1.2"

    # Name displayed for the release (optional, default = global releaseLabel value).
    # Use this property if you need to override the release label on a per-release basis.
    # You can use templating here, though it is usually not required.
    # Template parameters are the same as the global releaseLabel property.
    releaseLabel: "Timeturner Firebolt (1.2)"

    # Codename of the release (optional, not displayed anywhere by default).
    # It can be used as __CODENAME__ in the releaseLabel and changelogTemplate.
    # It is also returned as-is in the API.
    codename: firebolt

    # Date of the release (optional if releaseDateColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # It should be removed if releaseDateColumn is false.
    # Note that an approximate date is better than no date at all.
    releaseDate: 2017-03-12

    # Whether this is a "LTS" release (optional, default = false).
    # What LTS means may differ from product to product (see LTSLabel above).
    # Only provide for a release that will get much longer support than usual.
    # Alternatively, this can be set to a date when the product is not labeled
    # as LTS when it is released (ex. Angular) or when normal versions are
    # promoted LTS after their release (ex. Jenkins).
    lts: true

    # End Of Active Support date (mandatory if eoasColumn is true, else MUST NOT be set).
    # This can be either a date (must be valid and not quoted) or a boolean value (when
    # the date is not known or has not been decided yet).
    # - When a date is used, this is the date where bug fixes stop coming in.
    # - When a boolean is used, it must be set to true if the release cycle is not supported
    #   anymore, and false otherwise.
    eoas: 2018-01-31

    # End Of Life date (mandatory).
    # This can be either a date (must be valid and not quoted) or a boolean value (when
    # the date is not known or has not been decided yet).
    # - When a date is used, this is where all support stops, including security support.
    #   Note that this date reflects what is true for the majority of users (you may use the
    #   eoes field if possible/necessary).
    # - When a boolean is used, it must be set to true if the release cycle is End Of Life,
    #   and false otherwise.
    eol: 2019-01-01

    # End Of Extended/commercial Support date (optional if eoesColumn is true, else SHOULD NOT be set).
    # This can be either a date (must be valid and not quoted), a boolean value (when
    # the date is not known or has not been decided yet), or null.
    # - When a date is used, this is where the extended support period stops.
    # - When a boolean is used, it must be set to true if the extended support period is over,
    #   and false otherwise.
    # - When null is used, it means that there is no extended/commercial support for the given
    #   release cycle.
    eoes: 2020-01-01

    # Discontinuation date (mandatory if discontinuedColumn is true, else MUST NOT be set).
    # This can be either a date (must be valid and not quoted) or a boolean value (when
    # the date is not known or has not been decided yet).
    # - When a date is used, this is the date where the release cycle is discontinued.
    # - When a boolean is used, it must be set to true if the release cycle is discontinued,
    #   and false otherwise.
    discontinued: true

    # Latest release for the release cycle (optional if releaseColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # Usually this is the release cycle's latest "patch" release.
    # It should be removed if releaseColumn is false.
    # Always add quotes around this value.
    latest: "1.2.3"

    # Latest release date (optional).
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    latestReleaseDate: 2022-01-23

    # A link to the changelog for the latest release
    # (optional, default = the URL generated from changelogTemplate if it is provided).
    # Use this if the link is not predictable (i.e. you can't use changelogTemplate),
    # or if the changelogTemplate generated link must be overridden.
    # Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible.
    # Use the special value 'null' (unquoted) if you want to disable the link for a specific cycle of a
    # product having a changelogTemplate.
    link: https://example.com/news/2021-12-25/release-1.2.3
